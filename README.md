## Notes

This is my repo for all the challenges I am going to do.
I will name each .js by the challenge. I will try to remember too and what the challenge is in a comment on the top for them to make more sense.
I may go through them from time to time and update them as I learn. I will probably leave the old one commented out with a note that I updated my challenge

#Update

I started with using the .html file to do my .js but quickly found that to be a pain. I had to keep updating my script file path. I installed nodejs on my computer, which is a Linux Ubuntu. The problem with Ubuntu was their version in the repository was 12.8 I think which was fine till I kept getting an error in my code that made no sense. nodejs is based on Chrome V8 and the code I was using nodejs didn't recognize. Was a bit of a pain but finally after tweaking I got 18. something installed. Long story short nodejs makes doing these code wars way easier to run
